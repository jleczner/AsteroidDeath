            	Our planet has been around for about 4.5 billion years. In that time, it has been hit countless times by orbiting asteroids and comets. These objects, collectively known as Near Earth Objects or NEOs, still pose a danger to Earth today.
            </p>

            <p>
            	With the future in mind, as we address these dangers, there is also opportunity. Our life giving resources are precious and limited, but imagine the possibilities of reaching out to these mysterious rocks: drilling down to find ice we can
                melt to drink, valuable minerals like phosphorus and zinc needed for food production, metals like platinum and cobalt for continuing our efforts in space travel, and many more elements that fall under our resourceful application.
            </p>

            <p>
            	The need for action will come in a matter of decades, and it's never too soon to look towards the future. If space research has taught us anything, it's that life should never be taken for granted.
